      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">After twelve years as a certified teacher in elementary schools, most spent as a librarian, I've changed course to work in web development.  This inspiration to code began when I would code simple websites for my students to use as landing pages from which to go to the various websites used in each lesson. This led me to get interested in becoming a web developer.</p>

I'm currently studying HTML and CSS, preparing to have these basics well learned so that they become the backbone of my skillset. I am also learning Javascript.
